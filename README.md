I have a nack for enabling people and boosting teams. Quality will improve and your team members will shine if you add me to one (or many) of your projects. Also, I am quite a good software engineer and architect, too. So I'm looking forward to deep dives into hard problems, to then come out the other side with a solution that just works. I preferably do that around .Net, but have proven to be capable on other stacks (python) as well.

As such, my current employer - ERNI AG - has promoted me to *Subject Matter Expert Technical Quality*. I also take up positions as architect.

- **MSc ETH** in Mechanical Engineering
- 29\. June 1984
- I speak German and English fluently
  - with Swiss & British citizenship
- Speaker at Basel One 2022

## Projects

Mostly, I've worked on project revolving around the *.Net stack* and *git* repos. However, I am very comfortable switching technologies and/or stack, for instance to *python*. Also, I enjoy working for a broad variety of target environments and architectures, be those

- Plugin development as dynamically loadable libraries, for
  - *WPF* desktop engineering apps
  - medical instruments running customised Linux versions
  - including the use of [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) ML models.
- Containerised event based architectures
  - *RabbitMQ* & *Docker*
- Distributed systems in the (*Azure*) cloud
  - *Event Hub*, *Service Bus*, *Stream Analytics*, *Blob Storage* & *Cosmos DB*
  - Azure *Web Apps* (*Angular*) and *Functions*
- *Electron* based desktop apps
  - *Vue.js* & *ASP.Net* (Core)
- Service Based Architectures for desktop apps
  - WPF, [ZeroC ICE](https://zeroc.com/ice) & *MS SQL* (2012)

## Consulting

Since May 2019 for *ERNI AG*

During my time at *ERNI AG* I was involved in numerous consulting mandates. These typically involved my capability of quickly analysing a situation on a high level, understanding the status quo and coming up with viable ideas and solutions for the next steps. This has worked well irrespective of the technologies involved.

- *ToDo*: Manila
- Architecting a UI test framework using [Squish](https://www.qt.io/product/quality-assurance/squish) by Qt for a cpp solution, **Rotkreuz**
  - The test framework was to be implemented using python
- Review and design extension of a solution based on a broker architecture, **Schlieren**
  - Workflow management system using [Camunda](https://camunda.com/)
  - The broker orchestrates interaction between Camunda workflows and python processor scripts
- Code review of
  - service based system with focus on performance, **Zürich**
  - monolithic Xamarin application with focus on quality, **Zürich**
- Knowledge transfer process set-up for a near shoring team, **Bratislava**
- XML code-gen solution review and PoC, **Zollikofen**

## Software Engineering Passion

I use my passion in software engineering to connect components and technologies in a robust and maintainable fashion. This is supported by my love of also connecting people and teams and their respective expertise.

### Architecture

- Projects at EPH
- Experience in the industry
- Leading through book club sessions at EPH on FoSA

I am familiar with following architectures:

### Software Engineering

- My team abilities
- Analytic skills
- Mention tools only in a side note and stress importance of "portability" and openness.
  - VSCode, Draw.io, .editorconfig, etc
  - Don't want a "locked in" situation
  - Developers know best how they are most productive

### My Own SWE Projects

Out of the many projects I started out of curiosity at home, one has come to fruition: [Quantities](https://github.com/atmoos/Quantities).

ToDo: Expand

## Other Passions

- Avid sailor
- Dancer in training
- Keen traveller and hiker
- Has a nack for
  - baking sourdough bread
  - single board computers
  - software engineering
- Has one open source project
