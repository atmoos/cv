- Speaker at Basel One 2022 about software quality

I have a nack for enabling people and boosting teams. Product quality will improve and your team members will shine should you add me to one (or many) of your projects. Thanks to my love for quality, my passion for design and my keen ability to detect and solve issues, I consider myself a productive software engineer as well as a talented emerging architect.  
As such, I thoroughly enjoy deep dives into hard problems, to then re-surface with a solution that *just works*. I preferably do that around .Net ecosystems, but have proven to be capable on other stacks as well.

In my current position as *Subject Matter Expert Technical Quality* I promote engineering excellence by organising internal meetup events about technology, software design and engineering practices. I enjoy establishing similar formats when working for client projects.

## Projects

Most projects I've worked for revolved around the .Net ecosystem, which is where I am naturally most comfortable. However, I enjoy challenges as well as stepping out of my comfort zone every so often. As such, I've enjoyed working for a broad variety of target environments and architectures:

  - Gherkin BDD
- Distributed systems in the (*Azure*) cloud
  - *Event Hub*, *Service Bus*, *Stream Analytics*, *Blob Storage* & *Cosmos DB*
  - Azure *Web Apps* (*Angular*) and *Functions*
  - RESTful APIs
- *Electron* based desktop apps
  - *Vue.js* & *ASP.Net* (Core)
- Service based architectures for desktop apps

***On architecture:*** High level cloud architectures ([C4)](https://c4model.com/) & heading an architecture book club.

Due to my track record of improving quality in projects, I was sent to our subsidiary in Manila as a cultural bridge and ambassador of quality. We chose to set a focus on improving processes revolving around sales activities.

Additionally, I lead the (technical) design phase of multiple solutions aimed at the local market as well as supporting the sales team during client visits in the Philippines and Singapore.

## Consulting

Since May 2019 for **ERNI AG**

During my time at **ERNI AG** I was involved in numerous consulting mandates. These typically involve my capability of quickly analysing a situation on a high level, understanding the status quo, identifying areas of interest (typically issues) and then coming up with viable ideas and solutions for the next steps. This has worked well irrespective of the technologies involved.

- Client meetings in **Metro-Manila, Philippines** and **Singapore**.
  - Consulting for regular cloud applications
    - Including performance reviews
  - Consulting for AI/ML solutions embedded in medical and manufacturing environments
  - *Design Thinking* workshop for a multi-domain manufacturer
  - Cultural trainings bridging CH with PH
- Architecting a UI test framework using [Squish](https://www.qt.io/product/quality-assurance/squish) by Qt for a cpp solution, **Rotkreuz**.
  - The test framework was to be implemented using python
- Review and design extension of a solution based on a broker architecture, **Schlieren**.
  - Workflow management system using [Camunda](https://camunda.com/)
  - The broker orchestrates interaction between Camunda workflows and python processor scripts
- Code review of
  - service based system with focus on performance, **Zürich**.
  - monolithic Xamarin application with focus on quality, **Zürich**.
- Knowledge transfer process set-up for a near shoring team, **Bratislava, Slovakia**.
- XML code-gen solution review and PoC, **Zollikofen**.

## Software Engineering Passion

I use my passion for software engineering to connect components and technologies in a robust and maintainable fashion. This is supported by my love of connecting people and teams and their respective expertise.

### Architecture

I don't yet consider myself an architect outright, as the interplay between SW design (class level) and architecture (APIs, modules, technology) is still what fascinates me most. A bad design or implementation can (and will) thwart the most carefully designed architecture.  
This love for the interplay of high and low level worlds is one of the factors that makes me a valuable team member, lead developer or co-architect. A selection of practices I enjoy establishing for effective team work and *functioning* architecture:

- Good PR discipline and enjoyable PR experience for all developers
  - accompanied with a fit for purpose branching and deployment model
- Engaging tech-sessions or freaky friday sessions
  - ideally where every team member can contribute
- Minimal need for command and control (SonarQube, ndepend)
  - shaping awareness is far more sustainable and interesting for all involved
- Book club sessions based on [Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781663728357/)
  - an excellent book for an entry in to architecture

### Software Engineering

In my view, there is hardly anything more fulfilling than creating a coherent, type safe and useful library that provides a public surface that is almost trivial to understand and integrate into larger systems. This is when I get into "The Flow" and can loose track of time entirely.  
This passion together with my sharp eye for details and for the bigger picture is what makes me a productive engineer. Just as above, there are factors I believe are conductive to bringing this into software teams:

- Being a good team communicator and promoting the joy of producing high quality code.
  - [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) as a set of principles that can boost quality
  - Composition over inheritance combined with aspects of functional programming is equally beneficial
- Freedom of development environment (within good measure).
  - Open tools and tech: VSCode, Draw.io, `.editorconfig`, etc.
  - Developers know best how they are most productive
- The benefit of deliberate use of [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).
  - They are at least a means of communicating between developers
- The awareness of other programming paradigms and languages, for instance.
  - The benefits of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) principles
  - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)'s focus on safety & the novel concept of compile time ownership
- Awareness of the continued importance of algorithms and data structures.
  - Even with modern hardware and cloud systems, a sound analysis of time and space complexity is crucial
  - Where the targeted use of benchmarking can "prove" (and disprove!) practical benefits
- Unit testing as a means to produce better quality code.
  - Refactoring and feature extension can be done faster and more reliable with a good set of unit tests

### My Own Software Engineering Projects

I just love exploring new ideas and technology, which leads me to regularly embark on technological adventures. Out of these many projects, I'd like to mention the project that is most mature: [Quantities](https://github.com/atmoos/Quantities).

It is a .Net library to efficiently and safely handle physical quantities. A small code sample is possibly most illustrative:

```csharp
Time duration = Time.Of(2, Metric<Hour>()); // 2 h
Length kilometres = Length.Of(4, Si<Kilo, Metre>()); // 4 km
Length miles = kilometres.To(Imperial<Mile>()); // 2.4854 mi

Velocity slow = kilometres / duration; // 4 km/h

// (4km == 2.4854 mi)? --> true
Console.WriteLine($"({kilometres} == {miles})? -> {kilometres == miles}");
```
