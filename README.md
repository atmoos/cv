  - *WPF* desktop engineering apps
  - medical instruments running customised Linux versions
- Containerised event based architectures
  - *RabbitMQ* & *Docker*
- Distributed systems in the (*Azure*) cloud
  - *Event Hub*, *Service Bus*, *Stream Analytics*, *Blob Storage* & *Cosmos DB*

## Consulting

5\.2019 - ongoing

During my time at ERNI AG I was involved in numerous consulting mandates. These typically involved my capability of quickly analysing a situation on a high level, understanding the status quo and coming up with viable ideas and solutions for the next steps. This has worked well irrespective of the technologies involved.

- *ToDo*: Manila
- Architecting a UI test framework using [Squish](https://www.qt.io/product/quality-assurance/squish) by Qt for a cpp solution, **Rotkreuz**
  - The test framework was to be implemented using python
- Review and design extension of a solution based on a broker architecture, **Schlieren**
  - Workflow management system using [Camunda](https://camunda.com/)
  - The broker orchestrates interaction between Camunda workflows and python processor scripts
- Code review of monolithic Xamarin application, **Zürich**
- Knowledge transfer process set-up for a near shoring team, **Bratislava**
- XML code-gen solution review and PoC, **Zollikofen**

## Software Engineering Skills
