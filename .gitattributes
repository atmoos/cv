# To force normalize the files in the working tree, execute:
# git add --renormalize .

# Unset line ending normalization for all files by default
# This enables "as is" check-ins

# Other source code we might encounter
*.md text diff=markdown merge=markdown

# allow git to normalize its own settings files
.gitignore text
.gitattributes text

# Note: core.autocrlf will only affect files not listed here.
#       This ought to amount to processing no files as we
